## Initial Assessment
I’m excited about this project because of its potential to make a significant impact on the health and well-being of people with allergies. Although I don’t have personal food allergies, my fiancé’s experiences with allergic reactions to certain medications have opened my eyes to how critical it is to identify potential allergens quickly and accurately. This project allows me to channel that personal connection into creating a tool that could help prevent dangerous situations for others. I’m also motivated by the broader societal implications of this work. With food allergies becoming increasingly common, there’s a real need for simple, accessible technology that empowers users to make informed choices about what they eat. Furthermore, the transparency aspect—where users will be able to see the confidence levels of our AI model—makes the project even more appealing, as it aligns with my values of honesty and safety in software development. I see this project as more than just a school assignment; it’s a chance to create something meaningful that could genuinely improve people’s lives. The possibility of expanding this tool in the future to cover other allergens, like medications, gives me even more motivation to ensure its success.

## Final Assessment
My individual contribution to Qsine was extensive and aligned closely with the motivations I outlined in my initial assessment. I led the frontend development, ensuring that users had an intuitive and accessible experience when inputting recipes, scanning barcodes, or uploading food images. On the backend, I built and maintained the API that connected our user-facing features to the allergen detection model, and I integrated a custom AllRecipes.com scraper with a MongoDB database to provide a reliable source of real-world data. I also trained a YOLO-based image recognition model using over 125,000 food images and incorporated a barcode scanning feature by connecting to the MyFoodData API. These efforts combined to create a cohesive, end-to-end system that empowers users to identify allergens quickly and accurately—fulfilling the original vision I was so passionate about.

Through this project, I built significantly on the technical and personal goals I set last fall. I sharpened my skills in full-stack development, machine learning model training, and data integration, while also improving in project coordination and team communication. One of my biggest successes was balancing a wide variety of technical responsibilities and ensuring they all worked together seamlessly. A challenge I faced was time management, especially when juggling deep technical work like model training with frontend design and testing. However, overcoming those obstacles strengthened my confidence in handling complex, user-focused software development. Most importantly, I was able to channel my personal connection to allergy awareness into a working product that I believe could genuinely make a difference. This project didn’t just push me technically—it reaffirmed my passion for building ethical, impactful technology.
