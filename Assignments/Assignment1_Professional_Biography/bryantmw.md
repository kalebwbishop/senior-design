-- Wrote hundreds of test cases using Gherkin in C#

- Previously was an IT Major
-- The IT curriculum focused on Java and Web Development, so I have much more experience with those than the average Computer Science student

**Areas of Interest:**

**Type of Project Sought:**

- I am very flexible on what project I do. I don't want it to be something "easy" or that I already know how to do. This is an opportunity to work on a new skill that would be difficult to teach myself with an advisor to oversee the project. Below are some things I've considered that might be interesting
- 3D Rendering, Smartphone/Desktop app with a professional quality UI, useful Linux module, usable website, Audio Encoding, Systems Programming project to develop a physical tool
