### Meeting Schedule:
- **Frequency:** Biweekly
- **Day and Time:** Thursdays at 5pm
- **Duration:** 2 Hours
- **Location/Platform:** Discord

### Project Focus:
#### 1.	Image Recognition:
Using computer vision and deep learning techniques, the application will be able to analyze images of dishes. A model, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN), will be trained on a dataset of labeled food images to recognize a variety of common dishes.

#### 2.	Natural Language Processing (NLP):
In addition to image recognition, the application will also accept text-based descriptions of dishes. Using NLP techniques, the system will analyze text inputs and classify the dishes accordingly, making it accessible even without images.

#### 3.	Allergen Detection:
Once a dish is recognized (either through image or text), the application will query a database of ingredients associated with the dish and return a list of common allergens (e.g., peanuts, gluten, dairy). This may involve integrating external databases or creating a custom dataset that links dishes to their ingredients and potential allergens.
#### 4.	Dataset Creation and Management:
A significant part of the project will involve curating a dataset of food images and corresponding text descriptions, as well as a dataset of common ingredients and allergens. We will explore publicly available food datasets and possibly crowdsource information from food industry professionals.

#### 5.	Model Training and Optimization:
The project will include training a machine learning model using the collected data, evaluating its accuracy in recognizing dishes, and optimizing the model for performance improvements. Techniques like transfer learning could be used to leverage pre-trained models for food image recognition.

#### 6.	User Interface Development:
A user-friendly interface will be developed to allow users to upload an image or input a text description of a dish. The system will return the dish name and a list of associated allergens. This will likely involve developing both web and mobile applications to demonstrate the systemâ€™s functionality.

#### 7.	Testing and Validation:
The project will include extensive testing to ensure the system accurately recognizes dishes and returns correct allergen information. This includes testing on a wide variety of dishes, images, and text inputs, as well as ensuring robustness in different lighting conditions, angles, and levels of image clarity.
