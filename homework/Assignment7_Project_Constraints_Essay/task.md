# Project Constraints

Our project is focused on training an artificial intelligence to be able to identify potential allergens in text or images and integrating it into an accessible form.  One constraint that we see is our economics where we are operating with a very small budget. We must rely on open-source tools such as TensorFlow but costly datasets, tools and computational power are out of our reach. This project also has implications on our professional development in that it requires the specialized skills in the realm of computer science such as machine learning, NLP, image processing, and full stack development.  If our end product is unable to reliably deliver correct results, it will reflect on the reputation of each of us team members.  Security considerations will also be a constraint given the sensitivity of dietary information. We must ensure that all personal information is not tradable back to an individual, that all data transfers are confidential and that all data is stored securely. The largest constraint we have is health due to the impact of incorrect results. Posting a false negative could result in the user consuming an item that can harm them. Furthermore, a bad actor may falsify the data to make allergic recipies appear as non-allerhic. Thus, transparency is our strongest tool in giving users as much information as possible to guide their choices.
