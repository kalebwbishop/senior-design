            "Challah is an ancient Jewish bread that's had its share of internet fame (remember the rainbow everything fad? Or the mind-bending twelve-strand braided bread?). The basic blueprint has stayed the same: A rich, slightly sweet bread made with flour, eggs, oil, yeast, and honey. Whether you stick to the classic, top with poppy or sesame seeds, add golden raisins, shape it, stuff it, or swirl it, challah is one of the best (and easiest) breads to make at home.",
            "Read on to learn all about challah, from its symbolism in Judaism to how to braid, freeze, and use it (besides tearing big pieces right from the loaf).",
            "Challah bread is a white, leavened, braided bread with Ashkenazi Jewish origins. It's typically made with eggs, yeast, flour, honey (or sugar), and salt.",
            "Challah is a staple of every Jewish table on the sabbath \u2014 Friday evening to Saturday evening \u2014 and many Jewish holidays like Hanukkah and Yom Kippur (it's often the first food eaten to break the fast). Challah bread is also part of many important Jewish rituals, from weddings to funerals and nearly every occasion in between.The way the challah is braided or shaped also has its own meaning in Judaism. A three-stand brand symbolizes truth, peace, and justice. A braid with twelve \"humps\" represents the twelve tribes of Israel. Round or spiral-shaped challahs are eaten during Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, as a symbol of the cycle of the seasons.",
            "Both types of bread have lots of eggs and are known for their richness. The big difference here is butter. In a brioche, lots and lots of butter is incorporated into the dough. Challah is made without butter so it can be pareve (PAR-reve), or kosher in a meal that includes meat (Jews who keep kosher don't mix meat and dairy in the same meal).",
            "You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below \u2014 but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make challah bread at home:",
            "Activate the yeast.Make the dough.Turn out and knead the dough.Let the dough rise.Roll and braid the dough according to the below directions.Let the dough rise again.Add an egg wash and sprinkle with poppy seeds.Bake the challah bread until golden brown.",
            "Once your dough has risen, divide into three equal pieces and gently roll into 11/2-inch-thick ropes with the palms of your hands (the ropes should be about the same length). Pinch the ropes together at one end and braid fairly tightly. Pinch the opposite ends together. Tuck the ends underneath the loaf.",
            "Place your challah in a resealable bag and press out all the air before sealing. Freeze for up to three months or leave on your counter to enjoy all week. The oil and the extra eggs in challah bread help it stay soft longer than other loaves. And when it starts to go stale, it's time for bread pudding or French toast!",
            "Challah can absorb lots of liquid without falling apart, making it perfect for a custardy bread pudding, French toast, or even your Thanksgiving stuffing. Use challah in simple sandwiches (peanut butter and jelly is a fave) but skip it for sandwiches that need something sturdier, like a grilled cheese or a sandwich with lots of heavy fillings.",
            "\"This was a great challah recipe to follow,\" says reviewer jen. \"Delicious and quite true to Brooklyn bakery challah bread!\"",
            "\"WOW, this was my first time making challah bread,\" says Paula. \"It turned out beautiful. I didn't change a thing except used sesame seeds on top instead of poppy seeds. My husband couldn't wait for it to cool!\"",
            "\"For the longest time I thought challah was just too hard to make,\" says user Freshjiven. \"This recipe came out perfectly! I can now confidently serve homemade challah bread to my family!\"",

We did enjoy the occasional box of mac and cheese, or package of pop-tarts, but virtually all dishes like this ground beef stroganoff noodles were made from scratch.",

So, I decided to share this homage.",

Garnish with additional lemon zest, lemon slices, and chopped parsley, if desired.Asparagus has a fresh, mild flavor and a delightful crunch when it is lightly cooked as in this recipe. If you prefer asparagus less crunchy, you can cover the skillet, reduce the heat, and continue cooking until asparagus is tender."

Pot stickers are typically filled with ground pork and cabbage, but they can be stuffed with other ingredients too. They're usually pan-fried and steamed to give a soft, tender texture to the filling and a crunchy texture to the dumpling dough.",
            "You'll find the fully involved recipe below \u2014 but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:",

Mix until combined and refrigerate until chilled and ready to use.\nMake the Dough: Slowly pour hot water over flour and kosher salt. Stir until a dough forms. Knead the dough until smooth and elastic. Wrap the dough ball in plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes.\nMake the Pot Sticker Wrappers: Divide the dough ball into four equal pieces (keep the other pieces covered while working). Roll the dough into a log and divide into six equal pieces. Roll each piece into a pot sticker wrapper. Repeat until all dough is used.\nFill the Pot Stickers: Place a small amount of pork filling into the center of each wrapper. Wet the edges of the wrapper and fold the two sides together. Pinch the edges together. Tap the pot sticker on the work surface to flatten it, then add a slight curve so it can stand on its own.\nMake the Dipping Sauce: Combine rice vinegar and soy sauce in a bowl. Set aside until ready to serve.\nCook the Pot Stickers: Pan-fry the pot stickers until golden brown. Add water and steam for three minutes. Uncover and continue to pan-fry until water has evaporated and the pot stickers are crunchy.",

Add water to the skillet and cover \u2014 steam the pot stickers for three minutes. Uncover and allow to pan-fry again until the water has evaporated and the bottom of the pot stickers are crunchy.",
            "Chef John's dipping sauce for pot stickers is super simple and delicious. Just combine soy sauce and rice vinegar in a bowl. To dress up the sauce, you can also add hot sauce, garlic, minced green onions, or ginger.",
            "Store leftover pot stickers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to four days. Reheat in the microwave until warmed through. If you want the crispy bottom, reheat in the microwave until warmed through, then pan-fry in oil until crispy.",
            "Uncooked pot stickers are freezer-friendly. Simply follow the recipe until the pot stickers are assembled, but don't cook them yet. Transfer the pot stickers to a baking sheet and flash freeze them for a few hours (or until they're frozen solid). Transfer the now-frozen pot stickers to a zip-top freezer bag and freeze for up to three months.",
            "When you're ready to eat, there's no need to thaw the pot stickers. Simply follow this recipe to cook them from frozen. However, you may need to add a few minutes of cook time to account for the frozen temperature.",
            "\"My 17 yr old daughter said: 'It was better than restaurant quality,' says Denise Perchall. \"I did use wonton wrappers from the grocery, instead of making my own dough. Even using the pre-made wrappers, it did take me a little longer to prepare....but so worth it with the final product.\"",
            "\"Chef John nails it with this one, the video is great, very useful and helpful,\" according to Scott Jennings. \"The prep took a while, but I will definitely be making this again and I know I will get faster. It took me about 90 minutes from start to finish, and they lasted me and my family all of 90 seconds to devour.. so good, even the sauce was spot on!!\"",
            "\"Absolutely delicious. Tasted like it was from a restaurant,\" raves Greta K. \"I 100% recommend this recipe, especially for a dinner party appetizer. Assembly can be a bit time consuming, but it is fun and that's expected when making things from scratch. 5 stars!\"",

            "To make the filling: Place ground pork, green onions, garlic, ginger, 2 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon soy sauce, sesame oil, and cayenne in a mixing bowl. Top with chopped green cabbage. Mix with fork until thoroughly combined. Tamp down lightly; cover with plastic. Refrigerate until chilled, about an hour.",
            "To make the dough: Place 2 \u00bd cups of flour and kosher salt in a mixing bowl. Slowly pour in hot water. Stir with a wooden spoon until mixture forms a shaggy dough. Flour your hands and transfer dough to a work surface. Knead dough until it becomes smooth and elastic, about 3 to 5 minutes. If dough seems too sticky, sprinkle with a bit more flour, up to an additional 1/2 cup, and continue to knead. Wrap dough ball in plastic, and let it rest about 30 minutes.",
            "When dough has rested, divide into 4 equal pieces. Cover 3 pieces with a dish cloth while you work the first piece. Roll into a small log about the thickness of a thumb, about 3/4 inch. Divide each log into 6 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a thin 3 \u00bd-inch circle on a lightly floured surface to form the pot sticker wrappers. Repeat with the remaining dough pieces.",
            "Lightly moisten the edges of a wrapper with your wet finger. Place a small scoop of the ground pork mixture onto the center of a wrapper. Fold up the 2 sides and pinch together in the center. Pinch together the remaining edges, forming \"pleats\" along one side. Tap the pot sticker on the work surface to slightly flatten the bottom; form a slight curve in it so it stands upright in the pan. Transfer to a well-floured plate. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.",
            "To make the dipping sauce: Mix seasoned rice vinegar and soy sauce together in a small mixing bowl. Set aside.",
            "Heat oil in skillet over medium-high heat. Place about 6 or 7 pot stickers in the hot oil, flat-side down. Cook until bottoms are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Drizzle in water and quickly cover the pan; steam for 3 minutes. Uncover; reduce heat to medium. Continue cooking until water evaporates and bottoms are browned and crunchy, 1 or 2 minutes. Transfer to a warm serving dish. Repeat with remaining pot stickers.",

We make them with a variety of olives - pimento stuffed green, plump kalamata, Provencal - just make sure they are pitted. We like to use strongly flavored olives; the flavor of canned ripe olives disappears in the puff pastry. You can make these ahead, and freeze; allow 30 minutes for the pastry to thaw before baking. Another advantage: the kids like to make them and eat them.",

Stack another cake layer on top of the first, and repeat the process of frosting and filling. When the last cake layer is stacked on top, frost the top and sides of the cake with a thin layer of frosting. Use your hands to press the toasted coconut flakes onto the sides of the cake.

            "If you're a firm believer that potatoes make basically any meal taste better, then you've come to the right place. Because we are too \u2014 especially when it comes to breakfast potatoes.",
            "Choosing which type of breakfast potato to make can be a tough decision, but if you're craving crispy potatoes that remind you of your favorite restaurant, then you should try this hash brown recipe. The shredded potatoes are formed into pancake-like hash browns and lightly pan-fried for the perfect crispy texture that will pair deliciously with any breakfast dish.",
            "Believe it or not, making crispy hash browns is actually quite easy. First, shred your potatoes using your preferred method \u2014 either with a grater, food processor, or mandoline. Rinse the potatoes until the water is clear, then drain and squeeze out all the remaining liquid (this will ensure the hash browns are extra crispy).",
            "Next, you'll add in your binding agents (flour and egg) as well as any other ingredients or seasonings. This recipe only calls for onion, but you could also add cheese, cayenne pepper, or garlic to the mixture.",
            "Form your hash browns into patties (either one large hash brown or multiple smaller pancake-like hash browns) and pan fry them in oil, about five minutes on each side.",
            "To keep your hash browns crispy, make sure to heat the oil to sizzling before adding the patties and wait until the one side is golden brown before flipping.",
            "You can also make your hash browns thinner because they will get crispier and cook more evenly.",
            "If you care about the crisp, then you should use starchy potatoes, like russets or Idahoes. The only drawback is that the hash browns may be prone to falling apart because of the starchiness.",
            "So, if you want your hash brown to stick together easily, then you should use a waxy potato, like new potatoes, Yukon Golds, or red potatoes. These potatoes have more moisture and will stick together in the pan, however, they won't crisp up as nicely as starchy potatoes.",
            "The biggest culprit that's making your hash browns come apart is moisture. You need to make sure the potatoes are dry before adding them to the flour and egg mixture. Whether you squeeze them out in a dish towel or use a salad spinner, get the potatoes as dry as they can be.",
            "You can also use a different type of potato if you are worried about the hash browns breaking apart. If you use a waxy potato, they'll stick together nicely, but they won't get as crispy as you might want.",
            "Another option is to add more ingredients that will act as binders. Try adding cheese to your hash browns because when the cheese melts it will be like a gooey glue that holds your potatoes together.",
            "\"These turned out great! They weren't greasy at all, they held together perfectly, and they looked quite pretty when they were done cooking, too. Next time, I think I will add salt & pepper, plus some extra spices, to the shredded potato and egg/flour mixture, just to give it a more intense flavor. This recipe is so easy that I will have no problems just making these hash browns from memory, eyeballing the flour and spices,\" says eiskyjente.",
            "\"Unbelievable. About as good as one could hope for. Crispy on the outside, firm and tasty on the inside. And what a flavor. This will be my hash brown recipe from here on out. Make sure that you don't have too much oil in the pan. The hash browns will take forever to brown and may be too greasy for your taste,\" advises Curt McLey.",
            "\"My first try at making hash browns. Success. I added sharp Cheddar, a little garlic powder, a dash of oregano, and some green onions. I will keep this recipe and use it over and over. Always trying a little something different,\" raves MR BANANA.",

            "Gather all ingredients.",
            "Rinse shredded potatoes until water is clear, then drain and squeeze dry. Place shreds in a bowl and mix in the onion, flour, and egg until evenly distributed.",
            "Heat about 1/4 inch of oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When oil is sizzling hot, place potatoes into the pan in a 1/2 inch thick layer. Cover the whole bottom of the pan, or make separate piles like pancakes.",
            "Cook until nicely browned on the bottom, then flip over and brown on the other side. It should take at least 5 minutes per side. If you are cooking them in one big piece, it can be cut into quarters for easier flipping.",
            "Remove from pan, and drain on paper towels. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.",

I also often double this recipe and make 3 times the dressing and there is always great lunch leftovers remaining. People also love the dressing so more typically goes onto the salad when you let them self serve than would normally, and that's ok, it makes it very flavorful. You can also crush up the ramen not used when making the dressing, and top the salad with these as well. I prefer them without.",

            "The traditional Christmas Yule log might look intimidating, but it's actually quite simple to make when you break it down step-by-step. This Yule log recipe will quickly become a holiday staple in your household.",
            "A Yule log cake, a.k.a. a b\u00fbche de No\u00ebl, is a traditional holiday dessert that is meant to resemble an actual log. A sponge cake is baked in a Swiss roll pan, filled, rolled into a cylinder, then frosted again.",
            "The yule log tradition goes back centuries: Yule or Yuletide is a winter festival that was historically celebrated by people in Northern Europe. During the festival, a special log burnt on a hearth. Nobody quite knows where this custom comes from, but it's likely the inspiration behind the festive cake.",
            "This basic Yule log starts with a classic roulade. You'll find the full, step-by step recipe below \u2014 but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this Yule log:",
            "Make the filling.Make the cake batter and pour it into a prepared pan.Bake until the edges start to pull away.Turn the cake out on a kitchen towel, roll, and let cool.Unroll the cooled cake and spread the filling on top.Re-roll it, then sprinkle it with more powdered sugar. Refrigerate until firm.",
            "When the Yule log is filled and rolled, it's time to frost! To make the ganache frosting, simply whisk the chocolate chips and hot cream until smooth. Cut the ends off the log, then spread a layer of ganache all over the cake. Use a fork or knife to make ridges in the frosting. Continue until the log resembles tree bark.",
            "You can keep your Yule log simple or take it up a notch with whimsical decorations (check out our top-rated fondant recipe to make your own edible decor). Here are some gorgeous ideas from talented members of the Allrecipes community:",
            "Cover the frosted Yule log loosely in storage wrap and store it in the fridge for up to three days or freeze it for up to three months (thaw in the fridge overnight).",
            "\"I made a Yule log for the first time last Christmas using this recipe, and it turned out so fantastic,\" raves Nicki Bortz. \"It will definitely be a Christmas tradition. The chocolate filling and coffee liquor are what originally sold me, and it did not disappoint!\"",
            "\"Made this for Christmas and my husband loved it so much he wants this for his birthday,\" says Lynette. \"The buttercream and ganache were perfect. Not too sweet. The addition of the mascarpone and Kahlua puts it over the top!\"",
            "\"The amount of filling was perfect for me,\" according to Linda. \"I was pleasantly surprised that it did not stick like many others I've made. I did a display without mushrooms using cranberries greenery. On the outside of my plate I put little twigs.\"",

            "\u201cThere are a lot of factors that go into making a moist cookie,\u201d says recipe developer Amanda Holstein. \u201cHowever, my favorite \u2018secret\u2019 is to slightly underbake them, and let them rest on the cookie sheet until fully cooked\u2014the carryover baking from the hot sheet tray will continue to cook them without having them dry out in the oven.\u201d",
            "The result will be a gooey, berry delight, like a sugar cookie met a strawberry cheesecake. Any leftover cookies can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.",

Repeat procedure with remaining dough and cream cheese balls. Chill cookies, uncovered, 30 minutes.",

            "This pumpkin bread recipe is perfect to make when fall is in the air. Can't you just smell a delicious loaf of freshly baked pumpkin bread? Or is that just those of us who dream about pumpkin bread all day? No matter. This pumpkin bread recipe makes two moist and flavorful loaves - the perfect way to use up the cans of pumpkin puree you stocked up on at the first sign of autumn. And what better recipe to use than this Downeast Maine Pumpkin Bread? It's so beloved by members of the Allrecipes community, they have rated it 5 stars over 8,000 times.",
            "The great news is that this pumpkin bread recipe is actually incredibly easy to make. You don't even need an electric mixer (though, of course it helps). You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below \u2014 but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade pumpkin bread:",
            "Simply combine your wet ingredients, then combine your dry ingredients, then combine them all together.Pour into two loaf pans and bake until a toothpick comes out clean.",
            "The best part about this recipe is that it makes two loaves, so you can have one for now and one for later \u2014 or one for gifting!",
            "This recipe calls for canned pumpkin puree (make sure it's plain pumpkin, not pumpkin pie filling), which is quicker and easier than using fresh pumpkin. But, if you are feeling ambitious and want to use fresh pumpkin, follow this recipe to make pumpkin puree from scratch. A 1 \u00bd-pound sugar pumpkin will make about 2 cups of mashed pumpkin, which is the same as a 15-ounce can of pumpkin puree.",
            "Pumpkin bread is pretty dense, so it might be hard to know when it's cooked all the way through (and the last thing you want is to serve up a bread that's raw in the middle).",
            "So, to know when pumpkin bread is done, look for the crack on the top of the bread, which is a tell-tale sign it's either done or close to being done. Then stick a skewer or toothpick into the center of the bread. If it comes out clean, it's ready to come out of the oven. If not, leave it to bake for a few more minutes, then check again with a clean toothpick.",
            "Sometimes removing quick breads from their loaf pan is a tricky task. So, before you add the batter, make sure you thoroughly grease the pan.",
            "Then, after you've let the bread cool for about 10 minutes (or until you can handle the pan), run a knife along the edges of the bread. Gently shake the pan until the bread comes loose and you can turn it out onto a wire rack or plate. Then, let the bread continue to cool.",
            "You may be tempted to cut right into the bread, but you should let it cool completely before slicing into it.",
            "Pumpkin bread may be an easy quick bread to make, but sometimes recipes don't always turn out as planned. If you're having one of these common mistakes, here's how to fix it:",
            "Tough Bread: If you have a tough bread instead of a soft, cake-like texture, you're probably overmixing your batter. When making quick breads, you don't want to mix too much or else the gluten development will cause your bread to change in texture. Mix your ingredients until they are just combined \u2014 you should still have some lumps in the batter.Dry bread: Dry pumpkin bread is such a disappointment. To avoid dry, crumbly bread, try to keep your batter moist. Either do this by using less flour or adding more liquid \u2014 but don't add more oil. Instead, try adding orange juice or even bourbon to get some liquid into the batter.",
            "Wait until the bread is completely cool, then wrap it in plastic wrap or aluminum foil. Store it in a cool, dry place for up to four days, or in the refrigerator for up to one week.",
            "\"I make this recipe multiple times a year!\" says Allison. \"Making 2 loaves I take one to work and keep one home. Or give to a neighbor! I usually drop the sugar to 2 cups instead of 3 cups. And I have even done 1 \u00bd cups sugar and it still tastes wonderful Super moist too! My friends and family love love it!\"",
            "\"I can't even begin to describe this wonderful, cozy, comforting bread! There are no words! I made it exactly as stated and it was perfect!! End of story, no substitutions needed. It's like pumpkin pie for breakfast,\" raves Pamela Frechette.",

Then, place flour in one bowl, beaten eggs in another, and your panko mix in the third, which is a combination of grated Parmesan cheese, Italian-seasoned panko crumbs, and smoked paprika. Dredge your chicken and fry in a skillet with butter and oil.",

One of my earliest food memories is that of my grandfather making and serving me a frittata loaded with fresh garden vegetables. Besides loving the taste, and welcomed break from milk and cereal, I was fascinated by \"the flip.\"",
            "Traditionally, a frittata is mostly cooked, flipped over onto a plate, and slid back into the pan to finish cooking the other side. It's an exciting, risky maneuver, and more than one of his frittatas ended up a broken mess. (By the way, this is where I first learned how to swear in Italian).",
            "While my \"farmer's frittata\" is virtually the same as Grandpa's, I forgo the flip. Instead, I finish cooking the top under the broiler for a few minutes. Not only do we get a fast and perfect finish, we get to lightly brown all that beautiful cheese on the top. Anyway, both methods work. No matter which one you go with, I really do hope you give this amazing, Italian-style omelet a try soon. Enjoy!",
